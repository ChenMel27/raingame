# Seattle Rain Dash

## Summary
**Seattle Rain Dash** is a GBA game that is inspired by my childhood in Seattle, where avoiding the rain [without an umbrella] is our daily challenge!! This game really captures the typical Seattle day of dodging raindrops while trying to reach safety.

## Gameplay
- Control player by using **LEFT** and **RIGHT** keys
- Avoid getting hit by falling raindrops.
- Reach the **endpoint** to increase your score.
- Each time you reach the endpoint, YOU LEVEL UP and the rain **increases**, increasing the difficulty!
- Sorry, but if you get hit by rain, your **score resets to 0**.

## Features
- **Sound Effects:** Different sounds will play when reaching the endpoint [:)] or getting hit by rain [:(].
